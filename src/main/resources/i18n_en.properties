abstractinfo=An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject or discipline, and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose. When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or patent application. Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject. Typical length ranges from 100 to 500 words, but very rarely more than a page and occasionally just a few words.
introductioninfo=Should contain the following points: thesis statement or hypothesis, aim, research, methodical approach, overview of the papers structure.
mainpartinfo=The mainpart or body contains the bulk of information. The body can be separated into three parts, including the experimental methods, the results, and a discussion. The structure depends on the papers topic.
conclusioninfo=The conclusion is the final section and should tie all of the parts of a research paper together. It should explain why the research conducted was important and how it relates to other research that has already been published. The conclusion is usually only one or two paragraphs in a short research paper.
sourcesinfo=The reference page should list each of the books, journals, websites, and any other publications that were used to write the paper. The reference page can also be called a bibliography.
